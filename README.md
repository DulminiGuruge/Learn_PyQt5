### Create the virtual environment for PyQt5

PyQt5 is a Python library designed for developing graphical user interface (GUI) applications. To maintain a clean and isolated environment for my Python project, I've established a virtual environment to manage its dependencies. This repository contains widgets, layouts and interface examples for learning purposes.
 
First create a virtual environment using the below command in the terminal.

>python3 -m venv venv

This will create a folder named 'venv'. Then we need to activate the virtaul environment by executing the activate file inside venv/bin path. We can use the below command to activate the virtual environment in mac.

> source venv/bin/activate

Then install PyQt5 library using pip command.

>pip install PyQt5
